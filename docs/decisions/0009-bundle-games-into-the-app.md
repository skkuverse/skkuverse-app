# Bundle Mini Games Into the App

> Why 초록의 파도 moved from a web mini app into the app bundle, why its page still runs in a <!-- conventions:allow-korean: the game's product name -->
> web view, and how its leaderboard was first written. Read this for the history behind the
> bundled game pages.

## Status

Superseded on 2026-10-22 by [0021](0021-host-games-and-check-their-scores-on-the-server.md):
games become static sites on their own origins that the app hosts by URL, and a result
reaches the leaderboard through the `submitScore` callable. The bundled pages stay in builds
installed before that change, as 0021 describes. The current mechanism is
[in-app-games.md](../explanation/in-app-games.md).

Accepted in 2026-09, when wave-run and subway-typing moved into the app.

## Context

The mini games ran as web mini apps on their own origins, opened in the mini-app shell
([ADR 0006](0006-miniapp-webview-push-architecture.md)). A leaderboard needs to know who is
playing, and a web mini app cannot find out:

- The Firebase session and the App Check token live in native code only.
- The bridge is one-way, and the `app:auth-token` message it declares was never sent.
- The API's CORS grant covers the webview origin for `GET` only, so a game page could not post
  a score even with a token.
- Solving that properly is the v2 request/response protocol and a scoped token exchange
  described in the mini-app repository, none of which exists yet.

Meanwhile the app already has everything a leaderboard needs: Google sign-in restricted to
`@g.skku.edu`, Firestore, and AdMob.

## Decision

### 1. A game is an app asset

The game's source moves into this monorepo as a workspace package
(`packages/wave-run`). Its build emits the whole page (script, styles, art) as one string,
committed as `apps/mobile/src/features/games/wave-run/html.generated.ts`, and a native screen
loads it into a web view from that string.

The page keeps its Canvas renderer. Porting it to Skia was the alternative. It would have
removed the web view, but it adds a native module and so a `runtimeVersion` bump and a
store release for every change to the renderer. A bundled page goes out over OTA, like any other
JS.

This does not reopen [umbrella ADR 0005](https://github.com/spencer0124/skkuverse/blob/main/docs/decisions/0005-web-surfaces-dedicated-repo.md).
That ADR puts browser surfaces, meaning pages served from a host, in skkuverse-web. A bundled
game page is never served; it has no origin, cannot navigate, and speaks only to its host.

### 2. The host owns everything a run is worth

The page plays. The native screen owns the run stamp, the device best, revives, sign-in, the
profile and the leaderboard. They talk over `packages/game-host`, a contract separate from
`packages/bridge` because that one is vendored into skkuverse-web and hash-checked, and a
game's needs are not a web page's.

### 3. The host writes the leaderboard entry

The host writes the player's entry to `leaderboards/{gameId}/scores/{uid}` itself, citing the
run it stamped and copying the nickname and campus from the player's profile. One entry per
player holds their best. ADR 0021 replaced this client write with the `submitScore`
callable.

## Consequences

- A game change is an OTA, but the committed page must be rebuilt. CI rebuilds it and fails on
  any difference.
- Older builds keep opening the web mini app for the same registry id, so the web version
  stays deployed until those builds age out.
